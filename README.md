Belly Button Biodiversity

![Bacteria by filterforge.com](Images/bacteria.jpg)

In this project, I have built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Step 1: Plotly

1. D3 library to read in `samples.json`.

2. Horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

3. Bubble chart that displays each sample.

4. Display of the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

5. Display of each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

6.The plots will update any time that a new sample is selected.

## Advanced Challenge 

* Adapted the Gauge Chart from <https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/> to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.

* Modified the example gauge code to account for values ranging from 0 through 9.

* Update the chart whenever a new sample is selected.

## Deployment


* Used `console.log` inside of your JavaScript code to see what your data looks like at each step.

* Refer to the [Plotly.js documentation](https://plot.ly/javascript/) when building the plots.
